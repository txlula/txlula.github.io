# Introduction
For my A Level Computer Science coursework, I created a Restaurant Booking system in Python and the Django web framework. As it was my first coding project, I picked Python because it was a simple language to learn from its readability and a good starting project would be to create a booking system. I picked the Django web framework because I thought it would be
a good introduction to web programming, learning about the MVC (model-view-controller) model and saving simple data into a database.

The problem is simple: to minimise costs and manage restaurants efficiently. I previously worked as a waitress before and we took orders with paper and pencil rather than using a tablet. The restaurant used a restaurant management system - it was only used to save takeaway orders or manage tables in real time. For reservations, customers could only book by a phone call and these reservations were done on paper. Especially during peak hours for dinner (6-8pm), not everyone is available all the time to pick up these calls or cancel when needed. The solution would be to create a restaurant booking app for this purpose.

During this project, I followed a simple waterfall model which consisted of these steps:
1. Analysis
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing

# Ending
I have developed this project when I was still trying to understand web development and what the world of Computer Science is like during my A Levels. I think web development is always a great place to start off with when learning coding in general because it helps you to follow certain structures such as the MVC model and the documentation online is always useful. From this experience, I have learnt that a good program should follow these steps and although requirements change frequently and we hit certain limitations, it is important to prepare for this by clarifying requirements.
