# About Me
My name is Lucy Nguyen and I am a Software Developer. 👩‍💻

I like to code (and I aspire to code more when I can), and I studied BSc Computer Science with Placement at City University of London.
I also studied A Level Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics at Woodhouse College.

My initial dream career was to be a musician so I can play the piano (but I play casually and I teach myself). 🎹
I also like to play video games and card games. 🎮
